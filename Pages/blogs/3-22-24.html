        <h2>My Skills</h2>
        <p>I would say that my skills are both varied and mature, a "Jack of All Trades, Master of None". For the most
            part,the only skill that I have practiced thoroughly would be using Linux and its Command-Line Interface or
            Terminal.Most of my skills come from my school background. There are more skills and programming languages
            that I want tolearn such as Rust, Lua, and Python, but due to school and my schedule, it is quite hard to
            find time to learnthem. I also want to continue pursuing my interest in Cybersecurity, as I feel it is both
            an important andunderrepresented skill in IT. It is also one of the misunderstood fields, especially when it
            comes to the term"hacking" as the media turned it into an adversarial terminology. I still practice a lot of
            my fundamentals,which I want to include in my time replacing the time I procrastinate.</p>

        <h2>My Goals for My Portfolio</h2>

        <p>For my goal in my portfolio, it came from a website called <a href="https://mayadevbe.me/">MayADevBe</a>,
            a simple website without any clutter, with minimalistic design. To make it original, I would like to include
            someanimations that would replicate a Terminal or CLI. The CLI piqued my interest, and now that I have the
            tools andknowledge to try and learn it, my interest in it has risen more. I would like to make my index or
            landing pageas my about page, and add my contacts such as an email, Github, LinkedIn, etc. at the end of the
            landing page orin the footer of every page, but I am still not sure, as making it as an independent page
            makes it more formal,but I want to reduce a bit of work and clicks for the user. I would also like to
            integrate or at least showcasemy projects on Github; I have quite a bit of projects already done due to my
            old school projects. Lastly, likeMayaDevBe, I would like to make it my personal blog post, as I think it
            will show a peek at my personality,skills, and my ongoing projects that employers can read through if they
            want more information about me.</p>
